## Basic Information

To get setup just run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

- Set an **environment variable** for the `WANDB_USER_NAME` to sync correctly w/ Wandb.
- Set an envvar for the `DEVICE_TYPE` to use non-cuda device.
  To launch training run: setup a config yaml file, then run `python -m train /path/to/config.yaml` (or `torchrun`).

Before commiting, we recommend running installing and running the `pre-commit` hooks:

```bash
pre-commit install # one-time command
pre-commit run --all-files
```
